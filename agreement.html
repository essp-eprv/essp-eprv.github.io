											<h3>ESSP Collaboration Agreement</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
                                            As of March 26, 2025.
										</p>

                                        <h4>Overall Goal</h4>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The goal of the Extreme Stellar Signals Project (ESSP) is to optimize community-wide data challenges that gauge the performance and requirements of methods aimed at mitigating stellar signals in the radial velocity (RV) search for planets.  This collaboration agreement is intended to cover the many rounds of data challenges that will constitute the body of ESSP work.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Participation</h4>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The ESSP is open to participation from anyone or teams of people prepared to contribute mitigation methods at a level suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.  The collaboration may also include “spectators,” which are defined as those interested in staying on the loop (e.g. on the e-mail list host) while not specifically contributing a method or other results.  Participation will be reestablished at the beginning of each round of ESSP work.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            All participants are expected to:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Agree to this collaboration agreement</li>
                                                <li>At minimum abide by the <a href="https://aas.org/policies/ethics" target="_blank">AAS Code of Ethics</a> </li>
                                                <li>Follow the submission guidelines and requested data acknowledgements specified for each round of ESSP work</li>
                                                <li>Make their best effort to attend a low-number of meetings (~3) per data challenge to discuss progress and results</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Communication will be primarily e-mail based.  The ESSP website will also be kept up to date as much as possible.  If there is a conflict between the two, please contact the lead of the current ESSP round.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The ESSP executive committee (EC) consists of a small number of participants that meet on order monthly and lead the organizational work and analysis for current and continuing ESSP work.  Different rounds of ESSP work will be led by different ESSP EC members.  Membership of the EC will be re-established at the beginning of each round of ESSP work.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The current executive committee (Feb. 2025) consists of Khaled Al Moulla, Michaël Cretignier, João Faria, Jacob Luhn, Federica Rescigno, and Lily Ling Zhao.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The lead for the current round of work, ESSP IV, is Lily Ling Zhao.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Authorship</h4>

                                        <p>
                                            The result of implementing different methods on the same, distributed data set as part of the ESSP will be published in a final report for each round of ESSP work.  All participants identified as part of a team and/or identified as the contact for a given method will be offered authorship.  Authors will be ordered by a) principal contributors, b) method contributors, and c) data contributors.  Within each of those three sections, authors will be ordered alphabetically by last name.  Spectators will not by default be included as authors.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The first author for each ESSP report will be the ESSP EC member who is leading that round of work.  All ESSP EC members are considered principal contributors.  Other principal contributors, defined as those who make significant contributions to a given round of ESSP work, will be determined by the EC on a by-ESSP basis.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Suggestions for principal contributors, additional authors, and/or acknowledgements as well as any proposed author reordering can be sent to any member of the ESSP EC up until the deadline for paper comments for any given report.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Implementation</h4>

                                        <p>
                                            In cases of conflict or violations of the code of ethics, participants are encouraged to reach out to the ESSP EC.  The <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclzbYTv_394VuOWscJN49P2PijJJoBxLqXr6YGGZjbNMve_A/viewform?usp=sharing" target="blank">ESSP feedback form</a> offers an anonymous way to report issues.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This Collaboration Agreement will be reviewed at the start of each new round of ESSP work.  Comments, suggestions, and questions will always be welcome through contacting the ESSP EC or the optionally anonymous <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclzbYTv_394VuOWscJN49P2PijJJoBxLqXr6YGGZjbNMve_A/viewform?usp=sharing" target="blank">ESSP feedback form</a>.
