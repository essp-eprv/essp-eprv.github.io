The HELIOS solar telescope is located at the ESO 3.6m Telescope facility at the La Silla Observatory in Chile, and is connected to the HARPS and NIRPS spectrographs.

HELIOS (PI: Xavier Dumusque & Pedro Figueira) was funded through Portuguese FCT funding and the Branco Weiss fellowship. Maintenance and upgrade of HELIOS was possible thanks to support from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement SCORE No 851555) and from the Swiss National Science Foundation under the grant SPECTRE (No 200021_215200).
