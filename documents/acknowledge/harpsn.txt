The HARPS-N solar telescope is located at the TNG facility at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Spain, and is connected to the HARPS-N spectrograph.  The HARPS-N solar telescope (PI: Xavier Dumusque & David Phillips) was funded with support from Smithsonian R&D internal funding and the Branco Weiss fellowship.

The HARPS-N project was funded by the Prodex Program of the Swiss Space Office (SSO), the Harvard University Origin of Life Initiative (HUOLI), the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA), the University of Geneva, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), the Italian National Astrophysical Institute (INAF), University of St. Andrews, Queen’s University Belfast, and University of Edinburgh.  Maintenance and upgrade of the HARPS-N solar telescope was possible thanks to support from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement SCORE No 851555) and from the Swiss National Science Foundation under the grant SPECTRE (No 200021_215200).  We thank the HARPS-N solar team and TNG staff for processing the solar data and maintaining the solar telescope.
