% START HARPS ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The HELIOS solar telescope is located at the ESO 3.6m Telescope facility at the La Silla Observatory in Chile, and is connected to the HARPS and NIRPS spectrographs.  HELIOS (PI: Xavier Dumusque & Pedro Figueira) was funded through Portuguese FCT funding and the Branco Weiss fellowship. 

% START HARPS-N ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The HARPS-N project was funded by the Prodex Program of the Swiss Space Office (SSO), the The HARPS-N solar telescope is located at the TNG facility at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Spain, and is connected to the HARPS-N spectrograph.  The HARPS-N solar telescope (PI: Xavier Dumusque & David Phillips) was funded with support from Smithsonian R&D internal funding and the Branco Weiss fellowship.

The HARPS-N project was funded by the Prodex Program of the Swiss Space Office (SSO), the Harvard University Origin of Life Initiative (HUOLI), the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA), the University of Geneva, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), the Italian National Astrophysical Institute (INAF), University of St. Andrews, Queen’s University Belfast, and University of Edinburgh.  We thank the HARPS-N solar team and TNG staff for processing the solar data and maintaining the solar telescope.

% START HARPS/HARPS-N ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Maintenance and upgrade of both the HELIOS and the HARPS-N telescope was possible thanks to support from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement SCORE No 851555) and from the Swiss National Science Foundation under the grant SPECTRE (No 200021_215200). 

% START EXPRES ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
These results made use of the Lowell Discovery Telescope at Lowell Observatory. Lowell is a private, non-profit institution dedicated to astrophysical research and public appreciation of astronomy and operates the LDT in partnership with Boston University, the University of Maryland, the University of Toledo, Northern Arizona University and Yale University.

The EXPRES team acknowledges support for the design and construction of \expres\ from NSF MRI-1429365, NSF ATI-1509436 and Yale University. DAF gratefully acknowledges support to carry out this research from NSF 2009528, NSF 1616086, NSF AST-2009528, the Heising-Simons Foundation, and an anonymous donor in the Yale alumni community.

% START NEID ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This paper contains data taken with the NEID instrument, which was funded by the NASA-NSF Exoplanet Observational Research (NN-EXPLORE) partnership and built by Pennsylvania State University.  S.M. is the NEID Principal Investigator.  J.T.W. and P.R. serve as NEID Instrument Team Project Scientists.  F.H. is the NEID Project Manager.  We thank the NEID Queue Observers and WIYN Observing Associates for their skillful execution of NEID's nighttime observing programs and careful monitoring of NEID's calibration exposures.

NEID is installed on the WIYN telescope, which is operated by the NSF's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab).  The NEID archive is operated by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology.  Part of this work was performed for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, sponsored by the United States Government under the Prime Contract 80NM0018D0004 between Caltech and NASA.

This paper is based in part on observations at Kitt Peak National Observatory, NSF’s NOIRLab, managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. The authors are honored to be permitted to conduct astronomical research on Iolkam Du’ag (Kitt Peak), a mountain with particular significance to the Tohono O’odham.

Deepest gratitude to Zade Arnold, Joe Davis, Michelle Edwards, John Ehret, Tina Juan, Brian Pisarek, Aaron Rowe, Fred Wortman, the Eastern Area Incident Management Team, and all of the firefighters and air support crew who fought the recent Contreras fire. Against great odds, you saved Kitt Peak National Observatory.
